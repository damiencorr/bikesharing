## Citibike NYC with a view to demand in Des Moines
New York City's bike sharing service, known as Citibike, is an example of a popular bike sharing service. According to the bike ridesharing data from August 2019, the service clocked over 2.3 million individual bike rides in that month alone. The goal of this analysis is to use the citibike data as a reference to help assess the potential of a bike sharing service in the city of Des Moine, Iowa.

The citibike data contains information about the gender and age of the service users, as well as information about the locations of bike sharing stations, frequency of rides and ride durations between the stations. This analysis will visualize those aspects of the citibike service

We will use the visualization as a backdrop when comparing Des Moines' vs New York demographics. That comparison will be the driver to infer the possible level of demand for a Des Moines bike sharing service.

### Citebike in NYC
The service is mostly used by males, constituting over 70% of the ridership.
The average trip duration is similar for riders born in the 1960s-1980s time frame. 
There is small upward trend in ride duration among millennials.
The Majority of use is from Subscribers, constituting X%. The ready assumption is that Subscribers are city residents, communiting to and from work and other daily activities.
The center of Manhattan sees a significantly higher proportion of the Customer type of user, indicating a prevelance of casual/ad-hoc use likely associated with tourists.

### Citebike Des Moines Potential
Citibike data provides a template against which to consider the liekly demand for a Des Moines bike sharing service. 
The citibike service is mostly utilized by male riders, with female riders regularly employing the service though as a lesser proportion of overall usage.

NYC vs Des Moines populations
- Total populations
- Males versus females

According to the U.S. Census Bureau, Des Moines' male-female population ratio appears to be similar to NYC's, where Des Moines is 50.8% female whereas NYC is 52.3%. 
A Des Moines service might see ridership among females similar to that of NYC's.



The De Moise's tourism website highlights several aspects that may indicate demand for a bike sharing service.
- There are popular existing bike trails, attractive not only for residents but potentially also for tourists. The trails are 6-9 mile rides, a distance likely attractive to casual bike riders.
- Scenic outdoors, history, and culture could also attract ridership eager to explore the riches of De Moise.

## CHALLENGE DETAILS

### Instructions
The tasks for this challenge are broken up into four key steps: select your questions, do independent research, craft your story, and write an analysis.

Step 1: Select Your Questions
When putting together an analysis, the first thing to consider is what question you will try to answer. To select your question, consider the analysis you have done on the NYC Citi Bike data and consider what investors might want to know about Des Moines in order to decide whether a bike-sharing program would work there. The questions your team has landed on are below. Choose one to focus on in your analysis.

- What is the population of Des Moines? How does its population compare to the population of New York City? Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
- What is the gender diversity of Des Moines? How does it compare to the gender diversity of New York City? What effect does it have on possible business in Des Moines?
- What is the density of McDonald's in New York City versus Des Moines? Does this affect where people go in the city? If so, how?

Step 2: Execute Independent Research
The next critical step is conducting independent research. In this case, consult various resources to help you get a better picture of what a bike-sharing business would look like in Des Moines.

The goal is to find key pieces of information that are relevant to the question you selected and that will help investors arrive at a decision more easily. Here are a few resources you might look at:

- Des Moines Census Data (Links to an external site.)
- Des Moines Tourism Website (Links to an external site.)
- New York and Des Moines McDonald's dataset

Step 3: Craft Your Tableau Story
Create a Tableau story answering the question you selected. Use story points and arrows to describe your findings.

Then publish your Tableau story and dashboards to Tableau Public. Tableau Public is a way to share dashboards or stories that you have created online.

### NOTE
Tableau Public should not be used for dashboards containing potentially private data; for this you should use Tableau Server. Private data is generally data that would have an impact on a business or person if it were released into the public. Since the data you're using is not considered private data, you can use Tableau Public.

Next, copy the link to use in your written analysis.

Step 4: Create a Written Analysis
The goal of your written analysis is to share additional thoughts with your audience, expanding on details and clarifying points that they may not understand. Stories in Tableau can be fairly open-ended, so a written analysis allows you to further share your insights and interpretation of the data in order to help your case.

Content
Your written analysis can include all or some of the following:

- A summary of your analysis
- A summary of each page in the Tableau story
- Clarifying any data that is unclear or complex
